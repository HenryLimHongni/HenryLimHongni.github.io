I am currently a PhD student in School of Computing and Information Systems at University of Melbourne, supervised by  Prof. [Junhao Gan](https://sites.google.com/site/junhogan/) and [William Umboh](https://williamumboh.com). Before this, from September 2024 to February 2025, I served as a Foreign Trade Manager at Xianwei Technology (Shenzhen). This is an unforgettable and precious experience for me. During this period, I also worked part-time as a remote research assistant at HKUST(gz). I obtained a bachelor's degree from Sun Yat-sen University in 2024. During my undergraduate studies, I worked as a research assistant at the same school, supervised by [Zibin Zheng](https://sse.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/100).

**Research Interest**

Currently, my research focuses on developing efficient algorithms for graph databases. In the long term, I aim to build high-performance database systems that effectively support AI applications.
